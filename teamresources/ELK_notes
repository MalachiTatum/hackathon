Installation



	Elasticsearch
		wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.7.1.zip
		unzip
			Did nothing different, now works as service.
		Requires JDK 6 or later (1.7 is installed by default on AWS EC2 Machines)
		Currently testing "Sense" plugin for Chrome as a GUI
		Program freezing on ./elasticsearch -f
		Run via ./elasticsearch -d instead
		PUT
			creating data
			PUT classes/class/4
			{
			  "title": "",
			  "description": "",
			  "department": "",
			  "course": ""
			}
		POST
			for searching
			can use "query" command
			e.g.:
			POST /_search
				{
    				"query": {
        				"query_string": {
            				"query": "ford",
            				"fields": ["director"]
        				}
    				}
				}
			Can also filter these query results using "filter"
		Was having issues trying to get a GUI running because of the "localhost" issue
			Potentially resolved by Will's suggestion of specifying the ec2's IP or by using 0.0.0.0:9200 (default port is 9200 for http)
		Try private IP address in place of localhost
		Solved by opening port on AWS Security Group (maintain localhost:9200 as target url in config)
	Logstash
		Enabled some local testing which pushed logged lines as JSON objects to my locally running version of elasticsearch
		Currently running as a service on ChatOps_ELK_Logstash
		Have begun testing on EC2 servers but have not managed to incorporate the load balancer to handle inputs to logstash from multiple servers.

	Kibana
		To run kibana4 as a service, must run this command to install necessary lib 
			sudo yum install /lib/lsb/init-functions
			sudo yum install redhat-lsb-4.0
			Currently running on ChatOps_ELK_Kibana with nohup.out
			(I believe this is a daemon as well)





Commands

sudo su

yum update -y

cd /root

wget https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.7.1.noarch.rpm

yum install elasticsearch-1.7.1.noarch.rpm -y

rm -f elasticsearch-1.7.1.noarch.rpm

cd /usr/share/elasticsearch/

./bin/plugin -install mobz/elasticsearch-head

./bin/plugin -install lukas-vlcek/bigdesk

./bin/plugin install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-cloud-aws/2.7.0

bin/plugin -i elasticsearch/marvel/latest

cd /etc/elasticsearch

nano elasticsearch.yml

Config

Make sure to leave it as localhost (this way it can be contacted by publicip:9200)

http.cors.enabled: true

http.cors.allow-origin: "*"

Commands

service elasticsearch start (currently running as daemon but looking into installing/running as service)
	Issues here I believe are associated with Java not being properly linked to the service (No $JAVA_HOME variable set?)

Logstash 1.4.2
Commands

sudo su

yum update -y

cd /root

NOTE: To install most current version, simply go to https://www.elastic.co/downloads/logstash and copy the link to download the .zip file

wget https://download.elastic.co/logstash/logstash/packages/centos/logstash-1.5.3-1.noarch.rpm

yum install logstash-1.5.3-1.noarch.rpm -y

rm -f logstash-1.5.3-1.noarch.rpm

nano /etc/logstash/conf.d/logstash.conf

Config

input { file { path => "/tmp/logstash.txt" } } output { elasticsearch { host => "ELASTICSEARCH_LOAD_BALANCER_URL_HERE" protocol => "http" } }

Commands

service logstash start

NOTES:
Works as service - currently not working for load balancer. Not certain as to reason but I suspect it has something to do with the difference between running Elasticsearch as a service vs. running it as a daemon






Kibana 4.0.1
