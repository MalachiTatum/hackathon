		<h3>The scenario : </h3>

		<p>

			Your team of advanced engineering ninjas is tasked with helping ensure the future of our mystery site is bright. In order to keep the site from being corrupted with operational drift and technical debt we need to create a development process that eliminates these evils from creeping in. At the end of the event you will have an opportunity to showcase your DevOps skills in front of our esteemed judges. Please review the criteria closely and feel free to focus on a few or achieve them all. Improvements made to the mystery site itself will be appreciated but not weighted as heavily as the described criteria.

		</p>
		<br>
		<h3>The judges will be looking for the following from your solutions : </h3>
		<br>

		<ul>
			<li>Do you have a Continuous Integration mechanism?</li>
			<br>
			<li>Do you have a the capability to achieve Continuous Delivery, if you wanted to?</li>
			<br>
			<li>Does your solution use Containerization technology and how will it make the development better?</li>
			<br>
			<li>What Automated Testing does your process do before the code is moved to production?</li>
			<br>
			<li>What is being Monitored and how would people be alerted of potential errors ?</li>
			<br>
			<li>How are the Logs Managed ?</li>
			<br>
			<li>How will the team Communicate ideas, tasks, schedules, versions, and catastrophic errors ?</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>
			If some of these things aren’t familiar or too vague please don’t hesitate to ask around to one of the many SME’s walking by. They can point you to a few resources and answer any questions to get you going back on the keyboard.
		</p>

		<p>
			Also, no big deal, if you can’t get to them all, your goal should be to impress the judges with your devOps skills not how fast you can type. Ensuring all the different pieces of your solution work together will win you big points; after all, this is a DevOps competition.
		</p>

		<h3>
			Ready to get started ??!!
		</h3>
		<br>

		<p>
			First thing you need is to check out your awesome new environments in the sky. These will be the land to build your DevOps castle on. Each team has their very own set of 4 ubuntu boxes. We will be handing out a sheet with the IP addresses and you will get a usb that contains a .pem file. This pem file will allow you to ssh into your fancy new images. Please verify each machine is up and running now. Be sure to yell if anything smells fishy.
			Next step is to get the mystery site up and running.
		</p>

		<p>
			Excited yet ?? What is this mystery site ??
		</p>
		<p>
			Now is the time to pull the curtains, and reveal
